## Issue: Empty Recommendations Despite Valid Assessment Scores

### Date: 2025-01-15
### Severity: High
### Status: Resolved

### Problem Description
The recommendation engine was returning empty results despite receiving valid assessment scores. Debug logs showed:
- Assessment scores were valid: {complexity: 3.25, safety: 3.9, scale: 4, maturity: 3.65}
- Recommendation engine available: true
- Process data processes count: 0
- Final recommendations: {}

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was a data structure mismatch:
1. **Actual data structure** in `data/processes.json`: Direct array of process objects
   ```json
   [
     {"id": "acquisition", "name": "Acquisition Process", ...},
     {"id": "supply", "name": "Supply Process", ...},
     ...
   ]
   ```

2. **Expected data structure** in code: Object with processes array property
   ```json
   {
     "processes": [
       {"id": "acquisition", "name": "Acquisition Process", ...},
       {"id": "supply", "name": "Supply Process", ...},
       ...
     ]
   }
   ```

The recommendation engine was trying to access `this.processData.processes` but since the loaded data was a direct array, `processes` property was undefined.

### Solution Implemented
Modified `/js/app.js` in the `loadData()` method:

**Before:**
```javascript
const processes = await processesResponse.json();
```

**After:**
```javascript
const processesArray = await processesResponse.json();
const processes = { processes: processesArray };
```

Also updated the debug logging to show the correct process count:
```javascript
processes: processesArray ? processesArray.length : 0
```

### Files Modified
- `/js/app.js` - Lines 87-88 and 105

### Verification
After the fix:
- Process data now correctly structured with `processes` property
- Recommendation engine can access all available processes
- Recommendations are generated properly based on assessment scores
- UI displays tailored process recommendations instead of "No Recommendations"

### Prevention Measures
1. **Data Schema Documentation**: Added this documentation to prevent similar issues
2. **Validation**: Consider adding data structure validation during loading
3. **TypeScript**: If migrating to TypeScript, define interfaces for data structures

### Related Components
- `RecommendationEngine` class in `/js/components/recommendations.js`
- `SEFrameworkApp` class in `/js/app.js`
- Process data in `/data/processes.json`

### Testing Instructions
1. Complete the assessment with valid scores
2. Navigate to recommendations view
3. Verify recommendations are displayed instead of "No Recommendations"
4. Check browser console for debug logs showing process count > 0

### Impact
- **Before**: No recommendations generated, user experience degraded
- **After**: Proper recommendations generated based on assessment scores

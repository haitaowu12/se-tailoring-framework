# SE Tailoring Framework - Production Readiness Workplan

## Project Overview
**Current Status**: Functional prototype with complete assessment, visualization, recommendation, and export capabilities
**Target**: Production-ready web application with proper build process, testing, and deployment infrastructure

## Current State Analysis
- ✅ Complete frontend functionality (assessment, visualization, recommendations, export)
- ✅ Working local development server (Python HTTP server)
- ✅ Bootstrap-based responsive UI
- ✅ Data persistence via localStorage
- ✅ Professional PDF/JSON/Excel export capabilities

## Production Readiness Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (Current Phase)
- [ ] **Package Management**: Create package.json with dependencies
- [ ] **Build System**: Set up Webpack/Vite configuration
- [ ] **Development Environment**: Configure hot reloading and development server
- [ ] **Code Organization**: Restructure for modular development

### Phase 2: Code Quality & Testing
- [ ] **Testing Framework**: Set up Jest/Vitest for unit testing
- [ ] **E2E Testing**: Configure Cypress/Playwright
- [ ] **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier configuration
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Add TypeScript support
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and validation

### Phase 3: Security & Compliance
- [ ] **Security Headers**: Configure CSP and security headers
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs
- [ ] **Data Protection**: Secure localStorage usage patterns
- [ ] **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance audit

### Phase 4: Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Generate documentation for components
- [ ] **User Guide**: Complete user documentation
- [ ] **Deployment Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- [ ] **Hosting Setup**: Configure for Netlify/Vercel deployment
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Set up analytics and error tracking

## Task Progress Tracking

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Initial project analysis and assessment
- [x] Production readiness requirements gathering
- [x] Workplan creation
- [x] Package.json setup with proper dependencies
- [x] Development dependencies installation
- [x] ESLint error resolution
- [x] Test the build process
- [x] Development server enhancement

### In Progress
- [ ] Configure production build optimization

### Next Actions
1. Create basic test structure
2. Add proper error handling and validation
3. Performance testing and optimization
4. Security audit and vulnerability scanning

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: No current testing infrastructure
- **Medium Risk**: Manual dependency management
- **Low Risk**: Basic functionality already working

## Dependencies & Requirements
- Node.js >= 16.x
- Modern browser support (ES6+)
- Build tools: Webpack/Vite, Babel (if needed)
- Testing: Jest/Vitest, Cypress

## Timeline Estimates
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 days
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 days  
- **Phase 3**: 2 days
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 days
- **Total**: ~2 weeks for full production readiness

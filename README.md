## 🎯 Assessment Dimensions

### Project Characteristics (Weight: 25%)
- Project duration and timeline
- Team size and structure
- Budget and resource constraints
- Geographical distribution

### Technical Complexity (Weight: 30%)
- Technology maturity levels
- System integration complexity
- Innovation requirements
- Performance constraints

### Safety & Criticality (Weight: 25%)
- Safety Integrity Levels (SIL)
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Failure consequence analysis
- Risk tolerance factors

### Organizational Maturity (Weight: 20%)
- Process maturity assessment
- Team experience levels
- Infrastructure and tool support
- Change management capability

## 🔧 Configuration

### Process Definitions
The framework includes all 25 ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2023 processes:

**Technical Management Processes (8)**:
- Project Planning
- Project Assessment and Control
- Decision Management
- Risk Management
- Configuration Management
- Information Management
- Measurement
- Quality Assurance

**Technical Processes (17)**:
- Business or Mission Analysis
- Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition
- System Requirements Definition
- Architecture Definition
- Design Definition
- System Analysis
- Implementation
- Integration
- Verification
- Transition
- Validation
- Operation
- Maintenance
- Disposal

### Tailoring Levels
Each process supports three levels of formality:
- **Basic**: Minimal formality for low-complexity projects
- **Standard**: Structured approach for medium-risk projects
- **Comprehensive**: Rigorous processes for high-criticality systems

### Dependency Matrix
90+ interdependency relationships ensure process compatibility:
- **Horizontal Dependencies**: Same lifecycle stage coordination
- **Vertical Dependencies**: Cross-stage information flow
- **Constraint Enforcement**: Automatic level elevation for dependencies

## 📊 Scoring Algorithm

### Base Score Calculation
```javascript
baseScore = Σ(dimensionScore[i] × weight[i]) for i in [complexity, safety, scale, maturity]
```

### Level Determination
- **Basic (1.0-2.0)**: Simple projects with low risk
- **Standard (2.1-3.5)**: Moderate complexity and risk
- **Comprehensive (3.6-5.0)**: High complexity and criticality

### Constraint Application
